# Alpha
InitialStartup
Initially Alpha would have four directories.
1. Database - All changes for database
2. WebAPI - This would communicate to Database, no other application can connect to DB directly. This will be used for getting data or pushing data to database.
3. WebSite - The website to show all the currencies data
4. Crawler - The crawler would read some of the public websites and populate the database.
